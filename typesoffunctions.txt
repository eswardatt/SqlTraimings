In Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL), there are different types of functions that you can use to perform various operations and calculations within your SQL queries. The main types of functions in MSSQL include:

1. **Scalar Functions**:
   - **Scalar User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**: These functions return a single value and are created by users to encapsulate logic or calculations. Scalar UDFs are commonly used to simplify complex expressions within SQL queries.

2. **Table-Valued Functions**:
   - **Inline Table-Valued Functions**: These functions return a table variable and are defined using a single SELECT statement. They can accept parameters and are often used in the FROM clause of a query.
   - **Multi-Statement Table-Valued Functions**: Unlike inline table-valued functions, these functions use BEGIN...END blocks to contain multiple statements. They are used when more complex logic is required to generate the result set.

3. **System Functions**:
   - **Built-in Functions**: MSSQL provides a wide range of built-in functions that you can use for tasks like string manipulation (e.g., LEN, CONCAT), date and time operations (e.g., GETDATE, DATEADD), mathematical calculations (e.g., ABS, ROUND), and more.
   - **Aggregate Functions**: These functions perform calculations on sets of values and return a single value as the result. Common aggregate functions include SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, and MAX. They are often used with the GROUP BY clause to perform operations on grouped data.
   - **Window Functions**: Window functions allow you to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row, without reducing the result set. Examples of window functions include ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, and LAG.

4. **CLR Functions**:
   - **CLR User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**: Common Language Runtime (CLR) UDFs are functions created using .NET languages like C# or VB.NET. They provide flexibility and can be used to perform custom operations not easily achievable with standard T-SQL functions.

5. **Aggregate Functions for User-Defined Types (UDTs)**:
   - If you create user-defined types (UDTs) in SQL Server, you can also define aggregate functions specifically for those types to perform custom aggregation operations.

6. **String Functions**:
   - String functions like CHARINDEX, SUBSTRING, and REPLACE are used for manipulating and extracting data from strings.

7. **Date and Time Functions**:
   - Date and time functions like DATEADD, DATEDIFF, and GETDATE are used for working with date and time values.

8. **Mathematical Functions**:
   - Mathematical functions like ABS, CEILING, FLOOR, and ROUND are used for numeric calculations.

9. **Conversion Functions**:
   - Conversion functions like CAST and CONVERT are used to change the data type of a value.

10. **Cryptographic Functions**:
    - Cryptographic functions like HASHBYTES can be used for hashing and encryption tasks.

11. **Logical Functions**:
    - Logical functions like CASE and IIF help in making conditional decisions within queries.

12. **Ranking Functions**:
    - Ranking functions like ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK are used to assign rankings to rows based on specified criteria.

These various types of functions in MSSQL provide powerful tools for data manipulation and calculation within SQL queries, allowing you to perform a wide range of tasks in a structured and efficient manner.
