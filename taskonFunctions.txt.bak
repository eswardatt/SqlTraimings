Scalar UDF for Calculations:
Create a scalar UDF in a database of your choice. Design the UDF to accept two parameters 
(e.g., numeric values) and return the result of a specific mathematical operation (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). 
Use this UDF to perform calculations in SQL queries.

String Manipulation UDF:
Develop a scalar UDF that takes a string as input and returns a modified version of the string. 
You can choose to implement functionality like reversing the string, converting it to uppercase, 
or removing special characters. Use this UDF to transform strings in your database.

Date and Time UDF:
Create a scalar UDF that accepts a date as input and calculates the age of a person based on the input date. 
Use this UDF to query a table of individuals' birthdates and display their ages.

Table-Valued Function (TVF) Assignments:

TVF for Employee Information:
Design a TVF that accepts an employee ID as a parameter and returns a table with information about the employee, 
including their name, department, and job title. Implement this TVF to retrieve employee details from an employee table.
