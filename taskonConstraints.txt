Primary Key Constraint Assignment:
---------------------------------------------
Create a database schema for a library management system. Design a table for storing information about books. 
Define a primary key constraint for the table. Populate the table with sample data, 
ensuring that the primary key constraint is enforced.


Foreign Key Constraint Assignment:
---------------------------------------------
Extend the library management system schema from the previous assignment. 
Create a new table for storing information about library members. 
Define a foreign key constraint between the book table and the member table, 
representing the books borrowed by members. Populate both tables with sample data and 
demonstrate the use of foreign key constraints in maintaining data integrity.

Unique Constraint Assignment:
---------------------------------------------
Design a database schema for an e-commerce platform. Create a table to store product information. 
Define a unique constraint on the product code to ensure that each product has a unique identifier. 
Insert sample products into the table, including duplicate product codes, and observe how the unique constraint prevents duplicates.

Check Constraint Assignment:
----------------------------------------
Imagine you are building a database for a university to track student records. 
Create a table for student information and include a check constraint that ensures the age of a student is between 18 and 60 years old. 
Insert sample student records, including some that violate the check constraint, and demonstrate how the check constraint works.

Default Constraint Assignment:
----------------------------------------
Develop a database for a customer management system for a retail store. 
Create a table to store customer information and include a default constraint that sets 
the country of a customer to "USA" if not specified during data insertion. 
Insert sample customer records without specifying a country and verify that the default constraint sets the value correctly.
